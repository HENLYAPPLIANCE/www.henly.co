          <strong>Many commercial, manufacturing and industrial processes involve the use of water as a primary medium.
             These include the use of boilers and steam raising plant, cooling towers, cooling systems and other closed
              circuit systems. The water used in such systems, if left untreated can cause a number of problems leading 
              to increased risks to safety and health, reduced efficiency, and increased costs. These include the 
              unwanted growth of harmful bacteria and biofilm, the accumulation of scale (hardness salts), metallic 
              corrosion, bio-fouling and the build-up of suspended solids. The correct treatment of such system water 
              is therefore vital if these issues are to be effectively managed.</strong>

            <h5>SOLUTIONS FOR  DRINKING WATER TREATMENT</h5>
            <p>Water is the essence of life. We all depend on water for our survival, and we all have to take global 
              responsibility for it.Today many municipalities are faced with growing concerns about the availability of 
              usable water to meet the demand. Even in areas where water is plentiful, it must often be purified before 
              it is acceptable for drinking. Henly offers you a peace of mind by providing safe, relaible and cost 
              effective drinking water treatment programs geared for the needs of small communities and municipalities. 
              We offer the broadest range of products, services, technology and equipments to solve all your drinking 
              water issues, and the turnkey services that help you to manage your process and manpower.</p>
            <h5>CUSTOM DESIGNED WATER TREATMENT PLANTS, REVERSE OSMOSIS PLANTS & PURIFICATION SYSTEMS</h5>
          <blockquote>“First Test your water and analyse the contamination before the selection of filteration system”</blockquote>
          <p>After testing the raw water, the water testing lab will issue a water analysis report or water test result 
            certificate in a standard format as per the Indian Water standards. The water test results will show all the
             possible harmful contaminants listed and the actual value of contaminant present in the well or bore well
              water sample. Against the actual value of contaminants present in the well or bore well water sample will 
              also be given the acceptable maximum limit of that contaminant according to the Indian water standards or 
              in according to the WHO guideline water standards. Depending on the water test results of the well or bore
              well water, we will design the best suitable system to solve your water problem and provides you the most 
              advanced treatment solutions. </p>
              <blockquote>If you are on safe side on your Water Test report</blockquote>
              <p>If you are lucky with your bore or well water and the raw water test results proves that the raw water is 
              kind of okay and does not have any contaminants above the maximum contaminant level or MCL as recommended by
              the local governemnt or WHO Water Standards, then all you need to do is to have a simple water purifier for
              kitchen only for drinking and cooking purpose to remove bacteria virus,odours and to improve the taste of
              water.</p>
              <blockquote>If your water test report denotes a problem like some parameters are excess than the permissible 
              limits, you should submit the copy of same with us. We will be suggesting you a permanent solution for 
              same</blockquote>
